### a-star-redblob
This is a Golang implementation of RedBlobGames A* algorithm from 
[tutorial article](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html).


Original examples were written in Python/C++/C#. The logic is almost exactly the same as in the article,
I only translated it to Go. I did it while learning A* for my AI course at the university.

Anyone studying RedBlobGames tutorial can look here for reference.
I highly recommend getting familiar with their work.
